# Programming-1
All python programs I created for my Programming 1 module and Python OOP module.
These are all done in python, and helped me learn the basics of python like syntax, loops, recursion and object orientated programming.

All these are small programmes with just a few lines of code. With the text based python game being a slightly bigger programme.
